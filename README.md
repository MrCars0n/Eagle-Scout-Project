Technology-Based Eagle Scout Project - Children's Education Corner for Family Promise of Harrisburg

I created a childrenâ€™s education corner for kids to interact with programs from Sesame Street in Communities, regarding topics like family homelessness, substance abuse, incarceration of a family member, and more. This was done through a linked iPad and TV setup, allowing kids to play games and videos on the iPad while it is mirrored onto the TV. I also reorganized an adult computer area and designed informational posters to help homeless families find jobs and get back on their feet.
